This project provides the GUI for the [LegoBIM game](http://helgatauscher.de/legoBIM), presented at [Dresden Researchers Night](http://www.wissenschaftsnacht-dresden.de/english/) at the stand of the [Institute of Construction Informatics](https://tu-dresden.de/bau/cib?set_language=en). Some impressions from the first year can be found in [the archives](http://helgatauscher.de/legoBIM). The software is made with [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) and [Processing](http://processing.org).


Software
===========
To play the game you need a JRE version 11. You can check with `java -version` from the commandline.

Download the prebuilt binary from releases, unzip and run the jar.



Hardware 
=========
The self-made hardware in its first version reused a dismantled keybord controller to drive the game through food and palm switches.
The second version uses the Serial library and can those receive input through an Arduino controlled setup.
