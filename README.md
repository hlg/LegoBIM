This project provides the GUI for the LegoBIM game, presented at [Dresden researches night](http://www.wissenschaftsnacht-dresden.de/english/) at the stand of the [Instute of Construction Informatics](https://tu-dresden.de/bau/cib?set_language=en). Some impressions from the first year can be found in [the archives](http://helgatauscher.de/legoBIM). The software is made with Groovy and Processing, the hardware reuses a keybord controller to drive the game through food and palm switches.
